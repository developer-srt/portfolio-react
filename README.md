   1. Add a homepage field: <br>

   {
       "homepage": "https://srt-developer.github.io/portfolio-react/"
   }
   ```
   2. Add deployment scripts
   ```json
   {"scripts": {
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d build" //publishes build directory to gh-pages branch
   }}
   ```
4. Create a Production build <br>
Run the build command to create a production build of your React app: <br>
`npm run build` <br>
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages <br>
Deploy your app to GitHub Pages using the following command: <br>
`npm run deploy` <br>
This command will: <br>
   - Create a gh-pages branch in your repository (if it doesnâ€™t exist).
   - Push the contents of the build directory to the gh-pages branch. <br>

8. Troubleshooting
   - 404 Error: If you encounter a 404 error when navigating directly to a route (e.g., https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/about), 
   - you may need to create a 404.html file that redirects all unknown routes to index.html. This is similar to the Angular setup.
   - Ensure Repository Name Matches: The homepage field in your package.json must match the exact name of your repository.
